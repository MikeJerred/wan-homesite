            <h4>Full day observation</h4>
            <p>
                We observed the Starbucks in Holborn opposite the British Museum during a weekday from 8:30am to 7pm.

            <h4>Recording data</h4>
            <p>
                We recorded as much information as we could about each person that came in, our data includes biological information, activities, behaviours, sitting placement and duration in the shop.

            <h4>Data analysis</h4>
            <p>
                We put all the data in one spreadsheet and applied the AEIOU analysis framework. The total head count for the day was around 500 people, we scaled the numbers down proportionally in our model.

            <p>
                I sketched some initial ideas of how we could use the Starbucks cups as an element in the model.
