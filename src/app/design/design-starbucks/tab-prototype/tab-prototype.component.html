            <p>
                We used different coloured balls to represent different groups of people and placed them on a rough floor plan of the place to show their preferred sitting areas.

            <p>
                We used coffee spray to show how long people stayed, where the darker the coffee mark means the longer they stayed and vice versa.

            <p>
                I collected some used Starbucks paper cups and carved through some cups to create illustrations of peopleâ€™s behaviours in the shop.

                We focused on showing the seating arrangements of different groups of people, as well as the duration of their stay and behaviour when they were in the shop on a timeline of the day.
