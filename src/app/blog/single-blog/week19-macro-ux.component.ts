            <h4>Field research</h4>
            <p>After the feedback from last week, we decided to remove the element of lunar cycle in our concept and focus on menstrual sleep. In order to complement our literature reviews, we conducted 5 semi structured interviews and asked a few females who were on their period to record sleep dairies. We transcribed all the interviews and did category analysis for both the transcriptions and sleep dairies. The findings were consistent between the two, where most female had the following issues when sleeping on menstruation:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>Need for painkillers seems quite prevalent.</li>
            <li>Feelings of heaviness across the body.</li>
            <li>Stresses of leaking affects sleep quality.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We discovered that a proportion of females have difficulties with sleep especially in the first 1-2 days of menstruation due to physical pain and paranoia of the leaking. It has an impact on self-perception and personal emotion in their waking life. We want to connect the dots together and make people understand and empathise with the subtlety in menstrual sleep. For our presentation, we edited this short clip with the audio from each of our interviewee where they talk about the pain points during menstrual sleep. We felt that this was a more direct and immersive way to demonstrate their experience than just showing some quotes. </p>

            <h4>Second model</h4>

            <p>The qualitative data from our interviews and sleep diaries were the basis and inspiration for our second model. I had an idea of using Chun Li as a representation of a menstruating woman, because she’s a fictional character in Street Fighter games mostly seen as a strong empowering fighter like all women, however as a female she might experience difficulties with sleep during menstruation just like any of us. At the same time, Jordy also had an idea of showing how female suffers the pain and fear of leaking during menstrual sleep. We felt this idea could be integrated with the concept of Chun Li where we show how her sleep was suffered during the night and how she felt the next day. </p>

            <p>We had some debates within the team of whether it is appropriate to use a game figure in this context. Some of my teammates thought it might be a bit childish or unprofessional when we presenting to VentureThree. I believed that VentureThree is a creative agency who would be open minded to new ways of storytelling. However, it did raise a concern in my mind. We decided to do a very quick and simple demonstration and test it before the final version. After we had several positive feedbacks, it gave us assurance to move forward with it. </p>

            <p>The story had two parts, the day and the night. We chose to use an old TV screen to show Chun Li fighting to represent her day, and a box with sheet on representing her night. For the night, we recorded some sounds of moving around in bed to show she can’t fall asleep, at the same time we used some pins to poke the bedsheet from underneath to give viewers the impression of pain. There’s also the sound of going to toilet to change her pads after it leaked, which we used some red food colouring to leave red marks on the bed. For the day, we showed her fighting, but her mood was affected by the bad sleep. Please see below a demonstration. </p>

            <h4>Reflection-in-action</h4>

            <p>We also did a quick domo to Aliastair and see if he thought this is appropriate. He thought this concept is much clearer in delivering our message. Although we did not intend to portrait the deduction in productivity during menstruation, our choice of wording in the description were a bit misleading. We must be careful and avoid expressing any language has that indication. After his suggestion, we rephrased the description to “Through this model, we are aiming to demonstrate how female’s emotion and self-perception in her waking life can be influenced by bad menstrual sleep in subtle ways.”</p>

            <p>He also suggested that we should have a fighting scene before the menstrual sleep happened to create a contrast with the day after. We thought this was a very good suggestion and added this accordingly.</p>

            <h4>Practical review</h4>

            <img style="width:100%" src="/assets/blog/macro4/netflix.jpg">

            <p>I accidentally came across “Period. End of sentence” on Netflix, a documentary about Indian women fight the stigma surrounding menstruation and started by manufacturing sanitary pads. We watched it together to gather insights and inspiration. It was appalling to see what is deemed as bare necessity in this society, is in fact what people need to fight for in a different societal and cultural environment. The documentary reinforced our idea opening a discussion to change this still prevalent stigma but ensure it’s more related to menstrual sleep.</p>

            <p>We also did two practical reviews that are more relevant to our current direction, the first is the newly released  period emoji created as a new method of de-stigmatization and to allow young people to feel less embarrassed with having a dialogue on menstruation, which we feel could be an interesting area to pursue as many of our participants talked about how their periods were the worst in their teen years and felt they couldn’t talk to anyone about it. The other is a zine created by Soofiya a London based graphic designer who created the Bloodyhell zine to try to shift the discourse encompassing the taboo of menstruation using stories, illustrations & more from a wide variety of women. As an addition we interviewed Soofiya and got her opinions and experiences in designing in this area and how she felt we could take our experience further whether it’s with a device or an app service.</p>

            <h4>Feedback</h4>
            
            <p>The feedbacks we had from VentureThree were very positive. They loved the direction, and menstrual sleep is an area they didn’t consider in the development, we have plenty of design opportunities. They also liked our model and the way of storytelling. It communicated the concept clearly and effectively. However, they want the focus to remain on sleep and there’s a danger that our story might be too close to menstruation than sleep if not considered carefully. They also thought that we should not only create a campaign that increases the awareness around the subject, but also try to integrate with Dreem products.</p>


            <h4>Reflection-in-action</h4>

            <p>The feedback for our presentation was that the connection between menstruation and lunar cycle is quite controversial. Some women are strong believers whereas others don’t. Menstrual sleep is a strong concept on its own. Therefore, our designs were forced to connect these subjects together and hard for the audience to understand the main message. The comment is very constructive because our design is mostly based on literature review, it had very little interviews and observation to support our assumptions. Going forward, we are planning to conduct more field research.</p>

            <h4>Collaborative and / or Independent Professional Working</h4>
            <p>We all contributed ideas to which direction we should creat the model. Wendy and I conducted all the interviews and did most of the transcriptions and category analysis. Patrick asked his friends to record sleep daireis and did category analysis. Wendy also worked on the illustration and creation of the interview video clip. Wendy and Jordy worked on the model making, I helped them towards the end of the making process. I wrote the content and designed the presentation.</p>
