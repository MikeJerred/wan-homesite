                <h4>Initial brainstorming</h4>

                <p>After the briefing session from our industry partner, we did some brainstorming on the subject of sleep. The above picture on the left is from our discussion with the other two sleep groups, on the right is within our own group.</p>

                <h4>Literature review</h4>
        
                <p>In order to map out the experience of sleep, we first need to understand what is sleep and why do we need it? Seigel explained when someone is asleep, the sleeper ordinarily exhibits relative inattention to the environment and is usually immobile. More importantly, Kleitman and his student Aserinsky discovered that sleep was marked by periods of rapid eye movement, commonly known now as REM sleep. (Seigel, 2003) Although all of us sleep every day, the reason of why we sleep is not as obvious as other activities such as eating. The real function of eating is to supply nutrients, but we don’t have the equivalent straightforward answer for sleeping. There are a few current theories about why we sleep, but none of them are totally solid (Mignot, 2008):</p>

                <ul>
                <li>Sleep as energy conservation and ecological hypotheses</li>
                <li>Sleep as facilitating learning and memory through changes in brain plasticity and synaptogenesis</li>
                <li>Sleep as restoration of key cellular component of macromolecular biosynthesis</li>
                </ul>

                <p>There are a few major patterns in how we sleep: Monophasic, Biphasic & Polyphasic. Monophasic is most of us: sleep roughly 8 hours in one chunk of time, biphasic: sleeps in a 4hrs chunk, polyphasic: sleeps 2hrs, awake, then 30min, awake, sleep another 2hrs. We created a simple model to represent each type visually.</p>

                <p>We also explored the relationship between sleep and social life. The term BuddyClock - it enables users in a small social network to automatically share information about their sleeping behaviour with one another.</p>

                <p>Another important aspect of sleep is dream which there are many different theories on how to interpret it. For instance, Revonsuo’s theory (2000) proposes that dream allows threat rehearsal, providing an evolutionary advantage, it is argued that dreams reflect a general virtual rehearsal mechanism that is likely to play an important role in human cognitive capacities.</p>

                <h4>Practical reviews</h4>

                <p>We also did some practical reviews on projects that are related to sleep. On Wednesday, we went to an exhibition called “dream on” in V&A museum of childhood. Some exhibits recreated dreams from children’s dreams where the toys are awakened like in Toy Stories. The rest of the exhibition are photographs with children self-directed and role-played scenes in their dreams. This exhibition plays with the notion that objects come to life when we are not looking, much like our dreams as we fall asleep. Through the photos, you can see our dreams are in common to some degree, like dreaming about people without face, or always be chasing. </p>

            <h4>Initial ideas</h4>
            <p>We had some loose ideas such as:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>A fictional world where we no longer need to sleep.</li>
            <li>Napping pods to encourage napping at workplace.</li>
            <li>Looking into people’s dream, eg. sleeping but still working.</li>
            </ul>

            <img style="width:100%" src="/assets/blog/macro1/idea.jpg">
            <figcaption>One of the concept I explained to the team was looking at sleep and waking life as a reflection of each other. How you sleep directly affects your waking life and vise versa. One way to present this visually might be using a scale, on one side is your sleep and the other side is waking life. The scale needs to be balanced for the person to function properly.</figcaption>

            <h4>Collaborative and / or Independent Professional Working</h4>
            <p>Before we had seen the unit shedule, Jordy and I went to do some interviews on the street. Wendy and Patrick worked on some desk research. We all did literature review in different areas once we knew this week is supposed to be for desk research only. Wendy researched literature around the social aspects, Jordy on napping, Patrick on sleeping patterns and I was on dream. We all digged around for some practical reviews after finished our own parts and went to the V&A museum of childhood together. I had the idea of making a model to represent the sleep patterns, Wendy and Jordy made it together. I worked on the structure of our presentation, Wendy worked on the visual design and illustrations.</p>

                <h4>Reflection-in-action</h4>
                <p>In our presentation, we should have had proper reference links for every slide. We need consistently apply both names and years of the original source for all references across the entire presentation. We shouldn't jump too much in time without referencing anything in between. We also need to come up with more exciting ideas by doing more practical reviews.</p>
